                                My name is Santiago Lara Zapata, and I am a 19-year-old back-end developer with a basic understanding of front-end development. My main area of expertise is Java programming. I studied software development at a company called Riwi Desarrollo de Software, and I have one year of experience in development.
                               
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Currently, I live in Medell√≠n, Colombia, and I am almost fluent in English. What I enjoy most about programming is automating and streamlining processes. This passion drives my approach to coding and helps me create efficient and effective solutions for the projects I work on.
